# Rowdy's ESPHome configurations
These are my personal [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) configuration files that I mostly use for my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome/) instance. Feel free to review and use them.

## Usage
Please not that you need to have a *secrets.yaml* file. See the *secrets.yaml.example* file for some pointers.
